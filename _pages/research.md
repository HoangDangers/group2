# Frontier Research in Particle Physics

## Overview

Our overarching goal is to understand the Universe at its most fundamental level, including the constituents of matter and their interactions, and the nature of space and time itself. The quest to understand the fundamental building blocks of nature, and their interactions, is one of the most ambitious and enduring of human endeavors. Recent developments in particle physics and cosmology raise the exciting prospect that we are on the threshold of a major step forward in this understanding.

Our best theory of Nature -- the standard model (SM) --  is a quantum field theory based on a specific gauge symmetry group that describes the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions among fundamental particles. Development of the SM is a triumph of 20th century physics, with the last piece of the puzzle put in place by the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. But even without including gravity, we know that the SM is incomplete. The SM does not include neutrino mass and mixing which we know from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments to be a part of nature. Moreover, there are many open questions not answered by the SM, including: Why does nature express the symmetries embodied in the SM, and not other equally elegant symmetries?

* Why are there (only) three generations of basic building blocks of matter?
* Why are the masses of these building blocks so different from each other, both within a generation and between generations?
* What is the dark matter which pervades the Universe?
* Why is matter so dominant over antimatter in the Universe?
* Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3+1 dimensions of which we know?
* What mechanism stabilizes the Higgs mass from large quantum corrections at high energy?
* Are neutrinos their own anti-particles?
* Can gravity and quantum mechanics be described in a consistent theoretical framework?

Facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where our research is presently conducted, provides a unique window into the subatomic world where we are pursuing answers to some of these questions. The LHC is the world’s highest energy particle collider, accelerating and colliding bunches of 100 billion protons together with a center-of-mass energy of 14 trillion- electron-volts, creating conditions that existed only a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

Our research philosophy can be summed up by a quote traditionally attributed to Galileo (whether or not he actually said it is irrelevant):

> Measure what is measureable, and make measureable what is not so

Less eloquently, we can elaborate on the two parts of the quote above: The LHC affords researchers many observables to thoroughly test the SM and search for physics beyond it, so we should fully-exploit the capabilities of such a magnificent machine. Additionally, new techniques and technologies are required to push beyond current capabilities to measure what is not currently measurable – critical elements for the vitality of our field.

We know that the SM is incomplete as it only describes 4% of the energy density of the Universe. The rest is composed of mysterious dark matter (23%), seen only through its gravitational influence, and even more mysterious dark energy (73%), which drives an accelerating expansion of the Universe. Neither dark matter nor dark energy have explanations within the SM. The key question is exactly where and how to look for new physics, making both measure what is measureable and make measureable what is not so all the more important.

Currently, our instrument of choice  is SI-STM.  State-of-the-art SI-STM measures an array of tunneling spectra on a given sample, registered to the atomic sites with picometer precision. Each is proportional to the local density of states at a given location. Ideally, the recorded spectra are so tightly packed that the measurement yields a three-dimensional mapping of the local density of states as a function of locations and energy. This is shown on the image on the right-hand side (10x10 nm2), and its Fourier transform, below.

The quantum materials which we will investigate encapsulate some of the great unsolved mysteries of physics. They include high-temperature superconductors, quantum-critical compounds, graphene, and topological electronic matter that can be used for error-resistant quantum computing.

A main goal is to use modern technology to build the new instrumentation needed to understand these quantum materials. I learned my trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where we investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. This allowed me to learn new techniques such as high frequency measurements, low temperature noise-free amplification, and quantum-limited measurements. The goal is to combine these with SI-STM.

This will enable the instrumental capabilities to visualize the different quantum mechanical degrees of freedom needed to understand next-generation quantum materials. STM will be the main method, but we use different spectroscopic-imaging techniques to visualize not only the topography, but also the density of states, spins, and other degrees of freedom hidden below the surface.
